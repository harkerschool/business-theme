    <h2>Mentorship Program</h2>
    <p>
        CareerConnect mentorship offers sophomores and juniors the opportunity to participate in a rewarding, multi-faceted working relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
        Mentors show mentees what it&rsquo;s like to work in a field, give them an overall experience of the industry, and advise them on a future in it. Fields include Medicine, Business, Computer Science/Engineering, and Law.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><i class="fa fa-calendar-o"></i> April 15 &mdash; Kick-off Banquet</strong><br>
         Mentors and mentees will meet in person and devise a game plan.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the following months, mentors will show their mentees their work places, meet in person over a smoothy (students love treats) to offer guidance, and then over email and the phone. The goal is to &ldquo;connect&rdquo; in one form or another at least once a month.
    </p>
    <p>
        We&rsquo;re looking for more mentors! Contact us at <a href="mailto:CareerConnect@harker.org">CareerConnect@harker.org</a> if you are up for a rewarding mentor experience, or if you have a recommendation for a great mentor.

    <h2>B.E. Courses</h2>
    <p>
        We&rsquo;re thrilled to announce the launch of our brand-new business curriculum with two debut courses:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Principles of Business and Entrepreneurship&mdash;fall semester</li>
        <li>Advanced Fundamentals of Business and Entrepreneurship&mdash;spring semester</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Designed as a &ldquo;mini MBA&rdquo; each semester consists of four modules&mdash;marketing, accounting and finance, entrepreneurship, and strategy and management.
    </p>
    <p>
        The first semester delivers a broad-stroke approach, providing essential concepts and principles that are brought into action through a capstone project. The second semester delves deeper into the principles and concepts previously learned, through research and discussion of Harvard case studies, with various team/class projects interwoven throughout.
    </p>
    <p>
        Students will &ldquo;learn by doing&rdquo; as they step into roles of CEO, CFO, EVP &mdash;and more&mdash; to bring solutions to the complex and extraordinary challenges that business leaders face every day.
